# HyperionDev Chatbot: Flask Random Response App

This is a beginner-friendly Flask web application that acts as a simple chatbot. Users can type a message, and the app responds with a random sentence from a predefined list or generates a new one dynamically using the **Wonderwords** library.

---

## 📜 **Project Overview**

The project demonstrates how to:
1. Build a **Flask-based backend** for handling user input.
2. Use the **Wonderwords library** to dynamically generate random sentences.
3. Create a responsive and clean web interface using **Bootstrap**.
4. Combine HTML, CSS, and Python to build a simple end-to-end application.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**
- **Python (Flask)** – For backend logic and routing.
- **Wonderwords** – For generating random sentences dynamically.
